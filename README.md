## This is a config file for my Wireless Lily 58
Switches are choc sunsets and keycaps are MBK LP Blanks from https://lowprokb.ca/
  - Numbers are are MBK Legend Orthos leftover from a prior build\
Everything else is from typeractive.xyz
  - I will be adding nice!nano views once they are in stock

## I am iterating through things at the moment.  
Important keybinds that may look confusing in the layout image
  - Pressing **both** _shift_ keys (in the corners) will _caps_word_
  - Hold for _escape_, tap for _equals_
  - Hold for _Layer 1_, tap for _tab_
  - Hold for _left control_, tap for _backspace_
  - Hold for _shift_, tap for _space_
  - Hold for _Layer 2_, tap for _enter_

[Here is my most up to date layout!](https://github.com/noahetka/zmk-config-lily/blob/main/voyager_plus_colemak.zip)

## ZSA Voyager-esque Layout
Note that all _kp_equal_ have been changed to _equal_./ 
The former wasn't working for some odd reason, but I didn't feel like changing the graphic for such a change.
