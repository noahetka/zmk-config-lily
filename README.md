# zmk-config-lily
This is a config file for my Wireless Lily 58
![Everything except for the keycaps and switches are from typeractive.xyz](https://github.com/noahetka/zmk-config-lily/assets/27692471/5fb69065-889a-4bbd-bbb6-aa5f015b3046)
 
I am iterating through things at the moment.  
Important keybinds that may look confusing in the layout image
  - Pressing **both** _shift_ keys (in the corners) will _caps_word_
  - Hold for _escape_, tap for _equals_
  - Hold for _Layer 1_, tap for _tab_
  - Hold for _left control_, tap for _backspace_
  - Hold for _shift_, tap for _space_
  - Hold for _Layer 2_, tap for _enter_

[Here is my most up to date layout!](https://github.com/noahetka/zmk-config-lily/blob/main/voyager_plus_colemak.zip)

### Note that all _kp_equal_ have been changed to _equal_. 
The former wasn't working for some odd reason, but I didn't feel like changing the graphic for such a change.
